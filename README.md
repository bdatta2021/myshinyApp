# myshinyApp is based on the following research question:


Does vaccination status affect mask-wearing behavior(Criticize_Mask)?

The app incorporates Chi-square Test and Fisher's Exact Test to assess the relationship between vaccination status and mask-wearing behavior.

Here, Null hypothesis: Vaccination status and mask-wearing behavior are independent.
Alternative hypothesis: Vaccination status and mask-wearing behavior are not independent.

Test Results:
Chi-square Test: The Chi-square test result indicates a p-value=1, which means we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no statistically significant relationship between vaccination status and mask-wearing behavior.
Fisher's Exact Test: Fisher's Exact test also produces a p-value=1, reinforcing the conclusion that there is no evidence of a significant association between these two variables.

Graphical Presenation:
Bar chart: Displays the count of vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals categorized by mask wearing behavior.
Density Plot: Illustrate the probability distribution of vaccinated individuals in relation to their mask-wearing behavior.
Scatter plot: Provides a point-based visualization of the relationship between vaccination and mask-wearing criticism.


Conclusion: 
The statistical tests and graphical representation suggest that vaccination status does not significantly impact mask-wearing behavior. This means that individuals decisions to wear masks are independent of their vaccination status. However, further investigation with a larger dataset or additional factors could provide more insights into behavioral patterns.
